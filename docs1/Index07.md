# The “New Student Information Database” Python Script
*ASimpson, 03/06/2020*

## Introduction:
In this module and assignment, I learned about creating Python scripts that use files to store and access information.  
I also learned how to use “pickle” as a python way to store obscured data in a .dat binary file.  Finally, I learned 
all about how to handle errors that my code might generate.  

Specifically, I learned about: 
 - How to Read data from text files
 - How to Write Data from text files
 - How to Read/Write more complex data from binary files
 - How to intercept and handle errors during a program’s execution
 I also learned a bit more about GitHub web pages, how to use create a blog article to demonstrate python 
programming concepts.  

## Working with Text Files:
I learned on page 190 of Chapter 7, that with Python, it’s easy to read strings from plain text files-files that are 
made up of only ASCII characters.  Text files are a good choice for permanently storing simple information, for a 
number of reasons.  First they are cross-platform.  A text file on a windows machine is the same as a text file on a 
Mac.  Second, text files are easy to use.  Most operating systems come with basic tools to view and edit them.
